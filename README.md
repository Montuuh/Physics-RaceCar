# Physics-RaceCar

This is a Physics project from CITM studens (Videogame Design and Development degree). 
The goal of the game is to deliver peple to their destination.

## Rules
You must pick the clients up which are skin color by braking and carry them arround to their destination by braking which are the green cylinders. Once that is done the client will get out of the car and it will appear in green. 
To guide the player there is a green line that points to the right direction when picking up a client.
You have to deliver a total of five people to their destinations before 3 minutes time.
If the player wins the game restarts with the car in green color otherwise if the player runs out of time the game will restart with the car in red color.
